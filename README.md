# Lacrypto - Crypto exchange visualization

As I was never truly happy with available visualizations for crypto exchange
activity (yes, even [aggr.trade](https://aggr.trade)) I decided to write my own.

It might evolve in something else as my interests evolve. I am currently
curious about arbitrage techniques from a developer standpoint. If you are
experienced email me (it's on github) or something, let's talk :)


## Usage

In the project directory, run `yarn start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
